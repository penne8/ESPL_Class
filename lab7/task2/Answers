*)  If the main process would not close the write-end file,
    child 2 process will never recieve EOF.

*)  Nothing will change, main process doesn't read from pipe, therefor should close it.

*)  The main process would not close the write-end file before forking child 2.
    The main process terminates and exits without waiting for the children.
    Child 2 has an open-write fd, therefor, he won't recieve an EOF message,
    and will never terminate.
